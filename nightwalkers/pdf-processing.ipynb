Description of Executive Remuneration\\n6.1 Executive remuneration structure\\nExecutive remuneration has a fixed component and a component that varies with performance.\\nThe variable component ensures that a proportion of pay varies with performance. Performance is assessed annually for\\nperformance periods covering one year and three years. Payment for performance assessed over one year is an STI. Payment for\\nperformance over a three-year period is an LTI.\\nIn order for maximum STIs to be awarded, performance must achieve a stretch goal that is a clear margin above the planned budget\\nfor the period. This enables the Company to attract and retain better performing executives, and ensures pay outcomes are aligned\\nwith shareholder returns.\\nTarget STIs are less than the maximum STI. Target STI is payable on achievement of planned objectives. For executives, the target\\nSTI is 75% of the maximum STI. The maximum total remuneration that can be earned by an executive is capped.

       " 'Directors’ Report | 33\\n6.2 Fixed remuneration\\nFixed remuneration is the sum of salary and the direct cost of providing employee benefits, including superannuation, motor\\nvehicles, car parking, living away from home expenses and fringe benefits tax.\\nThe level of remuneration is set to be able to retain proven performers and when necessary to attract the most suitable external\\ncandidates from secure employment elsewhere.\\nRemuneration is benchmarked against a peer group of direct competitors and a sector peer group. While market levels of\\nremuneration are monitored on a regular basis, there is no contractual requirement or expectation that any adjustments will\\nbe made.\\nNo adjustment has been made to remuneration for the Managing Director since July 2012, other than a voluntary reduction in\\nhis fixed remuneration by 50% for the period 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 in recognition of the likely impact of the coronavirus\\npandemic on Downer and its people.

       " '34 | Downer EDI Limited\\nBoard discretion The Board may exercise discretion to:\\n§ Reduce partly or fully the value of the deferred components that are due to vest in certain\\ncircumstances, including where an executive has acted inappropriately or where the Board\\nconsiders that the financial results against which the STI performance measures were tested\\nwere incorrect in a material respect or have been reversed or restated\\n§ Settle deferred components in shares or cash.\\nNew recruits New executives (either new starts or promoted employees) are eligible to participate in the\\nSTI in the year in which they commence in their position with a pro-rata entitlement.\\nTerminating executives There is no STI entitlement where an executive’s employment terminates prior to the end of\\nthe financial year. Where an executive’s employment terminates prior to the vesting date, the\\nunvested deferred components will be forfeited. However, the Board has retained discretion\\nto vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or cash, in their ordinary course where the\\nexecutive is judged to be an eligible leaver.\\n6.3.2 STI overview\\nThe STI plan provides for an annual payment that varies with annual performance. This has been applied to performance measured\\nover the Company’s financial year to 30 June 2022.\\nThe basis of the plan is designed to align STI outcomes with financial results. No STI is paid unless a minimum profit gateway is\\nmet. For corporate executives, the gateway is based on the Group budgeted profit target. For Divisional executives, the gateway\\nis based on the Division budgeted profit target. Profit for this purpose is defined as NPATA for Corporate executives and EBITA\\nfor Divisional executives. This minimum must be at a challenging level to justify the payment of STI to an executive and deliver an\\nacceptable return for the funds employed in running the business. Positive and negative impacts from material but unbudgeted and\\nopportunistic transactions are excluded from gateway assessment. Whether to exclude the impact of significant items (positive or\\nnegative) is considered on a case by case basis.\\nAs noted in section 6.1, the maximum STI that can be earned is capped to minimise excessive risk taking.\\nDeferral is a key feature as part of the STI structure. Payment of 50% of the award is made at the time of award in cash and the\\nremaining 50% of the award earned is deferred over two years.\\nThe first payment of 50% of the award will be in cash after finalisation of the annual audited results. The payment of the deferred\\ncomponent of the award will be in the form of two tranches, each to the value of 25% of the award.\\nThe deferred components represent an entitlement to cash or shares, subject to the satisfaction of a continued employment\\ncondition. The first tranche will vest one year following award and the second tranche will vest two years following award, provided\\nan executive remains employed by the Group at the time of vesting.\\nThe value of deferred components will generally be settled in shares, net of applicable personal tax. This is designed to encourage\\nexecutive share ownership, and not adversely impact executives who have to meet their taxation obligations arising from the\\nvesting of the deferred components. However, the Board retains the discretion to vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or\\ncash, and will generally have regard to an executive’s individual circumstances and existing level of equity ownership.\\nNo dividend entitlements are attached to the deferred components during the vesting period.\\nWhere an executive ceases employment with the Group prior to the vesting date, the deferred components will be forfeited.\\nHowever, the Board has retained the discretion to vest deferred awards, in the form of shares or cash, in their ordinary course\\nwhere the executive is judged to be an eligible leaver.\\n6.3.3 How STI payments are assessed\\nTarget STI plan percentage An individual’s target incentive under the STI plan is expressed as a percentage of fixed\\nof pay remuneration. The STI plan percentage is set according to policy set out in section 6.1.\\nOrganisational or divisional As a principle, ‘target’ achievement would be represented at budget. Thresholds and maximums\\nscorecard result are also set.\\nIndividual Performance At the end of the plan year, eligible employees are provided with an IPM against their key\\nModifier (IPM) performance indicators and relative performance. Individual key performance indicators are set\\nbetween the individual and the Managing Director (if reporting to the Managing Director) or the\\nBoard (if the Managing Director) at the start of the performance period. IPMs must average to 1.\\nSTI plan incentive calculation Fixed remuneration x maximum STI plan percentage x scorecard result x IPM.',\n",

       " 'Directors’ Report | 45\\nThe Board’s determination to adjust incentive outcomes for major transactions and significant items as set out in sections 7.4.1\\nand 7.4.2 did not impact incentive outcomes for executives as the earnings gate was not met.\\nThe Board considered this outcome and whether it was appropriate.\\nThe impact of widespread COVID-19 infections within the community and the restrictions placed on businesses and employees\\nby government was not anticipated at the time targets and forecasts for 2022 were set. Additionally, the prolonged and severe\\nwet weather patterns experienced throughout Australia’s eastern States have been debilitating and unprecedented. The impact\\nof COVID-19 and severe wet weather patterns materially impacted the Company’s financial performance.\\nNotwithstanding the difficulties presented during the period our staff and management responded outstandingly in highly\\nchallenging circumstances, maximising outcomes for shareholders, protecting not only the performance of the Company but also\\nthe communities in which Downer operates, all while delivering quality service outcomes for customers. If not for this ‘above and\\nbeyond’ effort, Downer would not be in the strong position it is in today.\\nDuring the period the executive team continued to improve the Company by:\\n§ Completing the exit of the Open Cut Mining East and Otraco businesses, delivering on the strategy to exit capital-intensive\\nbusinesses and significantly decreasing the Group’s carbon emissions profile\\n§ Completing the exit of the Hospitality businesses, improving the Group’s resilience and reducing volatility\\n§ Acquiring Fowlers Asphalting in Victoria’s Gippsland\\n§ Completing the sale of our Rosehill Asphalt Plant and the construction of a world-leading replacement plant.\\nThe Board assessed the impact of COVID-19 and severe wet weather on executive performance KPIs and formed the view that the\\nexecutive was likely to achieve at least target earnings performance in 2022, in the absence of those impacts.\\nAfter extensive deliberation of these issues and the Company’s financial and non-financial performance, the Board determined it\\nimportant and appropriate to exercise discretion to award an STI outcome of 65% for the executives, which is between threshold\\nand target. In keeping with policy, 50% of these awards are deferred.\\nIn assessing the appropriate level of award the Board has balanced the challenging environment for shareholders and the strong\\ncompetition for talent and retention across Australia and New Zealand, which is unparalleled in recent years.\\n7.4.4 Future periods\\nFor major transactions completed in 2022, the impact on operational performance is included in the 2023 budget and accordingly\\nno adjustments are expected in respect of FY23 operational performance.\\n7.5 Variations from policy\\nThere were no variations from policy in 2022.',\n",

       " '50 | Downer EDI Limited\\n11. Description of Non-executive Director Remuneration\\n11.1 Non-executive Director remuneration policy\\nDowner’s Non-executive Director remuneration policy is to provide fair remuneration that is sufficient to attract and retain Directors\\nwith the experience, knowledge, skills and judgement to steward the Company.\\nFees for Non-executive Directors are fixed and are not linked to the financial performance of the Company. The Board believes this\\nis necessary for Non-executive Directors to maintain their independence.\\nNon-executive Directors are not entitled to retirement benefits. Shareholders approved an annual aggregate cap of $2.0 million\\nfor Non-executive Director fees at the 2008 AGM. The allocation of fees to Non-executive Directors within this cap has been\\ndetermined after consideration of a number of factors, including the time commitment of Directors, the size and scale of the\\nCompany’s operations, the skill sets of Board members, the quantum of fees paid to Non-executive Directors of comparable\\ncompanies and participation in Board Committee work.\\nThe Chairman receives a fee of $410,625 per annum (inclusive of all Committee fees) and superannuation. The other Non-executive\\nDirectors each receive a base fee of $164,250 per annum. Additional fees are paid for Committee duties: $35,000 for the chair of the\\nAudit and Risk Committee; $27,000 for the chair of each of the Zero Harm Committee and Remuneration Committee, and $17,000\\nfor the chair of the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee.\\nThe basis of fees and the fee pool are reviewed when new Directors are appointed to the Board, when the structure of the Board\\nchanges, or at least every three years. Reference is made to individual Non-executive Director fee levels and workload (i.e. number\\nof meetings and the number of Directors) at comparably sized companies from all industries other than the financial services sector,\\nand the fee pools at these companies. In addition, an assessment is made on the extent of flexibility provided by the fee pool to\\nrecruit any additional Directors for planned succession after allocation of fees to existing Directors.\\nA review of fees was conducted in 2021. The review found that base fees paid to the Chairman and Non-executive Directors\\nremained appropriate however fees paid for chairing or serving as a member of a committee were below market levels. Accordingly,\\nas foreshadowed in the 2021 Remuneration Report, the following changes in fees were applied from 1 July 2021:\\n§ Fees set at a fixed value inclusive of superannuation, rather than a fee plus superannuation at the superannuation guarantee rate\\n§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Remuneration Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\\n§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Zero Harm Committee to $27,000 from $16,425\\n§ Increase in the Chairman fees for the Tender Risk Evaluation Committee to $17,000 from $16,425\\n§ Introduction of fees for committee members at the rate of 50% of the respective committee Chairman fee.',\n",

       " 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements | 123\\nRecognition and measurement\\nDerivative financial instruments\\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are\\nsubsequently re-measured to their fair value at each reporting date. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of\\nderivatives, except those that qualify as effective hedges, are immediately recognised in profit or loss.\\nHedge accounting\\nAASB 9 aligns the accounting for hedging instruments closely with the Group’s risk management objectives and strategy and\\napplies a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness. The Group has elected to adopt the\\ngeneral hedge accounting model in AASB 9. AASB 9 includes requirements on rebalancing hedge relationships and prohibiting\\nvoluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting.\\nFair value hedges\\nFair value hedges are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset, liability or firm commitment.\\nFor fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or\\nliability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are immediately recorded in profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when\\nthe hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\\nCash flow hedges\\nCash flow hedges are used to hedge risks associated with contracted and highly probable forecast transactions. For cash flow\\nhedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is deferred in equity and the gain or loss relating to the\\nineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\nAmounts deferred in equity are transferred to profit or loss in the same period the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss. When\\nthe forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the gains and losses previously\\ndeferred in equity are transferred to form part of the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or liability.\\nIf the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised\\nimmediately in profit or loss. If the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge\\naccounting, any gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.\\nG3.
